# OpenDRIVE

This serves as an OpenDRIVE 1.4 parser for my [Guided Research](https://github.com/Brucknem/GuidedResearch) at the
[Providentia++](https://innovation-mobility.com/) project.

It is made to extract the world positions of landmarks from the OpenDRIVE HD maps that have been bought during the
project.
